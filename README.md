# SignalCraft

A strategic market intuition game.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Observe the market patterns (Trends, Ranges, Volatility).
3. **Buy** when you see an opportunity, **Sell** to lock in profits.
4. Unlock tools like the **Auto-Strategy** (Level 2) and **Regime Hints** (Level 3) by leveling up.
5. Your progress is saved automatically.

## Running Locally
Since this game uses no external frameworks, you can simply open the file directly:
*   Double click `index.html`
*   OR run a local server (e.g., `npx serve .` or `python -m http.server`) for the best experience.

## Design Philosophy
*   **Minimalist & Premium**: No distraction, just signal.
*   **Education by Play**: You learn to spot regimes by feeling the pain of losses and the joy of gains.
*   **Progressive Disclosure**: complexity is hidden until you prove you are ready.
